# WEEK 1 CHALLENGE

## Project
Twitter Users' Segmentation

## Business Need
Nike Inc is planning a new digital campaign in Africa, and wants to understand who the social
media influencers are in Africa and in which area fall into (e.g. politics, fashion, art, etc.). This is
key to Nike as they donâ€™t want to be associated with the wrong influencers (ethnic and religious
polarisation figures for example).  
They want to think about:
* Could they try to partner with or hire some key influencers to amplify their planned digital
campaign?
* How are the influencers endorsed by key government officials?
* Which topics are important for both influencers and key government officials?

## Objective
The main objective is to help Nike Inc. identify top African twitter influencers that is best fit for partnership
or hire for its digital campaign in Africa.

* Interim solution
* Final solution
